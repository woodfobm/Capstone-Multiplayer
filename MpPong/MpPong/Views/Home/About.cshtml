    <h2>ABOUT PONG</h2>
    <p>Pong is one of the earliest arcade video games and the first sports arcade video game. It is a table tennis sports game featuring simple two-dimensional graphics. 
    While other arcade video games such as Computer Space came before it, Pong was one of the first video games to reach mainstream popularity. The game was originally 
    manufactured by Atari, which released it in 1972. Allan Alcorn created Pong as a training exercise assigned to him by Atari co-founder Nolan Bushnell.</p>

    <h4>Andrew Frideres</h4>
    <p>
        This is my fourth semester here at CVTC, and I am in the IT Software Development program. 
        My hobbies include gaming, and programming in what little spare time I have. 
        Other then that i am usually busy working, and i tend to kind of overwork myself, but it helps to keep me busy and out of trouble! 
        Other then that I am a huge fan of classic rock, and whenever i am working on anything even semi important i usually have it blasting, and over the summer month me and my dad usually go on trips to rock concerts.

    <p>
        I am currently in my fourth semester here at CVTC for the IT-Software Developer program. 
        I don't currently have a job but I used to work at the Harbor View Cafe down in Pepin! 
        I've worked there since I was fifteen, but the hour drive and poor working conditions made me decide to move on. 
        Enough about that however, I also quite enjoy playing video games in my free time and have quite a collection when it comes to my favorites.

    <h4>Brandon Woodford</h4>
    <p>
        This is my last semester in the IT-Software Developer program at CVTC.
        This fall, I plan on attending UW-Eau Claire for a degree in Computer Science. 
        If everything goes well I should be graduating in 2020. 
        In my free time I enjoy playing video games, listening to podcasts, and programming. 
        Most of my spring break was spent playing Overwatch and working on my personal website.
